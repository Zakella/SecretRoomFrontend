      <h2>The Birthplace of<br />Transparent Beauty</h2>
      <p>
        The Secret Room began as a pop-up shop
        in Chisinau, Moldova. That was back in 2020, when many people
        weren’t aware of the kinds of ingredients or environmental footprint
        of their personal care products.

        <h3>Our Standards</h3>
        <p>
          We’ve got your back. Everything we carry has been meticulously vetted,
          so instead of worrying about the nitty-gritty, you can enjoy what green
          beauty is all about: finding new ways to support your well-being, and
          having a great time along the way.

        <h3>Our Process</h3>
        <p>
          From the hundreds of submissions we receive each year, less than two
          percent earn a spot in our curation. To pass the test, products have to
          be unquestionably best in class, free from anything on our Banned
          Ingredients List, and made by founders who share our passion for
          transparency and authenticity.

        <p>

          industry, what matters most is not only awareness, but advocacy and
          action. We are committed to leading by example and being the industry
          change we want to see.
